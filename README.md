##

It also allows for specific reports to be ran such as Month to date, Year to Date, Previous year and even results filtered by the vendor.

## Future Work

- Simply setting the first letter of vendor names could go a long way for professionalism and aesthetic
- Balance tracking to transform this into an active Finance Tracker rather than profit/loss tracking
- Users should be able to search by amount, item, color or customer keyword of their choice
- Automated/ Recurring payments would also be cool to incorporate
